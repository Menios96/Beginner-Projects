C++ Game Simulations
Overview

This repository contains two console-based C++ programs that simulate classic games:

Rock–Paper–Scissors

Roulette

The project demonstrates fundamental programming skills in C++, with emphasis on clear logic, user interaction, and structured code design.

Projects Included
🎮 Rock–Paper–Scissors

A simple implementation of the classic hand game where the user plays against the computer.
The program handles user input, random choice generation, and game outcome evaluation.

🎰 Roulette

A basic simulation of a roulette game, focusing on randomization and rule-based outcome determination.

Key Concepts Demonstrated

Control flow (conditionals and loops)

Functions and modular code structure

User input validation

Random number generation

Console-based interaction

Basic game logic design

Technologies

Language: C++

Application Type: Console

Compiler Compatibility: GCC, Clang, MSVC

How to Run

Compile and run each program separately using a standard C++ compiler.

Example:

g++ rock_paper_scissors.cpp -o rps
./rps


or

g++ roulette.cpp -o roulette
./roulette

Purpose

This project was created as part of my learning journey in C++ and is intended to demonstrate core programming concepts and problem-solving skills.
It is included in my portfolio as an example of entry-level C++ development suitable for internships or junior roles.

Possible Improvements

Improved input validation

Enhanced game rules and features

Code refactoring and documentation

Object-oriented design extension
